## Hi

I have a passion for creating efficient and innovative code. Here are some of the things I enjoy working on:

- **Web Development:** Building responsive and dynamic websites.
- **Automation:** Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Web Scraping:** Using BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites.

In my free time, I like to:

- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Participate in coding challenges and hackathons.
