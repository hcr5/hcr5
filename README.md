## Hi

I'm **hcr5**. I like to script in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

I have a passion for writing efficient and fun code. Here are some of the things I enjoy working on:

- **Web Development:** Building responsive and dynamic websites.
- **Automation:** Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Web Scraping:** Using BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites.

In my free time, I like to:

- Explore new programming languages and technologies.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Participate in coding challenges and hackathons.
